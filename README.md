## About This Project

This project is an interactive web application and detailed analysis that summarizes and visualizes the key findings from PortSwigger's groundbreaking research paper, **"HTTP/1.1 Must Die: The Desync Endgame."**

The goal is to make the core concepts, real-world impact, and necessary solutions understandable to a broader audience through two formats:
1.  An **interactive single-page application** for a high-level, visual understanding.
2.  A **detailed written analysis** for a deeper technical dive.

**Key Features of the Interactive Report:**
* **Interactive Diagrams:** Visualizing the core "desync" flaw in HTTP/1.1.
* **Data Visualization:** A chart showcasing the significant bug bounties awarded for these vulnerabilities.
* **Case Studies:** Summaries of compromises affecting major platforms like Cloudflare, Akamai, and Netlify.
* **Actionable Recommendations:** Role-based advice for security teams, developers, and the industry at large.
